# BroforceMods
This repository contains the source code for a few mods I've made for the game Broforce

For anyone interested in creating their own mods for this game, feel free to use my code as a starting off point. The MainTemplate.cs provides a clean slate for starting off. It has most of the setup needed to work with Unity Mod Manager. If you have questions or encounter any bugs in my mods feel free to contact me:
