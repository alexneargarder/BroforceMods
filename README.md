## How to Create Your Own Mods
For anyone interested in creating their own mods for this game, feel free to use my code as a starting off point. 

The ExampleMod provides a basic template with a lot of comments to explain how everything works. It has most of the setup needed to work with Unity Mod Manager. It is set up as a Visual Studio Project, so you should just be able to download everything and open the .sln file. I use Visual Studio 2019, I imagine it would probably work with newer versions.

There is also a file called MainNoComments.cs that has the same code as the ExampleMod but with no comments, which may be more useful for you if you want to use that project as a template for making your own mod. You can simply download the whole project and copy and paste the code from the MainNoComments.cs to set everything up.

The Compiled Mod folder can be placed into your Mods folder here to see what this example mod does:
C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Broforce\Mods\Compiled Mod
There is also an Info.json file in the Compliled Mod Folder that shows you how you need to have that set up.
