# Swap Bros Mod

This mod allows you to instantly swap bros at the press of a button, filter the bros you can spawn as, or choose to always spawn as a specific bro.

## Installation Instructions

Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434812447).

There may be some slight incompatibility issues when using the Filtered Bros mod or Expendabros in game mod with this mod. I would advise against installing those mods together with Swap Bros as Swap Bros can already do filtering or adding in the Expendabros.

## Bugs and Issues

## Current Features

**Clicking a new bro causes swap** - Controls whether selecting a new bro in the mod menu will cause your character to change in game. This won't do anything if you're not in game.

**Always spawn as chosen bro** - Controls whether you will spawn / respawn as a random character like normal or stay on the same one.

**Include Expendabros bros** - Adds the bros from Expendabros into the pool of available characters to swap to.

**Ignore currently unlocked bros in IronBro** - Allows you to swap to bros you haven't unlocked yet while playing IronBro. If it's disabled you will only swap between ones you have unlocked.

**Include BroMaker Bros** - Adds custom bros created via BroMaker into the pool of available characters to swap to. This won't do anything if BroMaker isn't installed.

**Filter Bros** - Hides the disabled bros and only allows you to spawn as / swap between enabled bros. Bros can be enabled / disabled by clicking the enter filtering mode button.

**Use Vanilla Randomization** - Controls whether the method for choosing which bro to spawn you as is completely random, if the option is disabled, or if it prefers to spawn you as bros you have yet to play on that level, if the option is enabled. This only affects the spawning method if Filter Bros is enabled however.

**Include Unfinished Bros** - Adds Chev Brolios, Casey Broback, and The Scorpion Bro to the available bros to swap between.

**Ignore Forced Bros** - Controls whether the Filter Bros option will override forced bros for specific levels such as the Muscle Temples, where you are supposed to be forced to spawn as Indiana Brones.

**Please note if you would like the Expendabros, BroMaker Bros, or Unfinished Bros to be part of the spawning pool, you have to enable the include option for them and then make sure the "Filter Bros" option is checked. If you only enable the include option they will only be added to the pool of bros you can swap between.**

You can bind a key for swapping your current bro, and you can do this for each player. Swap bro left will go left on the table and right will go right on the table. It will loop around if you try to swap left on Rambro or right on Demolition Bro.

This is what the filtering mode looks like:
