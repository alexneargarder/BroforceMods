## Installation Instructions

Detailed installation instructions can be found [here](https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2434812447).

## Bugs and Issues

If you run into any bugs or have any issues with the mod, please join the [Free Lives Discord](https://discord.com/invite/freelives), and post in the bf-mods channel.

## Current Features

Play with up to 3 additional players in IronBro.

Lives and unlocked bros are shared. So if one player unlocks a bro, everyone gets an additional life and access to that bro. If someone dies with a bro, that bro is lost and everyone loses a life.

There is an option in the mod settings to have the helicopter wait for all players to get on it before it leaves. This is important in this mode because if a player dies after the level is beaten in IronBro, that death is carried over. This feature might cause some issues on some levels, so if you get problems with the helicopter not leaving, try disabling it.

Also, currently no one has ever beaten the game on IronBro in multiplayer to my knowledge, as very few people have played this mod. If someone does beat it, definitely let me know as that would be awesome.
