## Credits

- Thanks to Gorzon for making BroMaker. He turned my Captain Ameribro idea into something much greater and put in a ton of work to make all this possible.
- Thanks to FishTsar for making all the sprites. They all turned out many times better than anything I could have done by myself.
- Thanks to BruxelasCouveRocko for drawing the cutscene animation. It ties the whole mod together.
